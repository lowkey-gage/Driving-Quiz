I got the starting document structured how I would like it and then added a small CSS framework ontop of what I already had structured down.
By day 4, I quickly relized that I was missing out on a few things and didnt like how it just showed a heading, picture, paragraph and button, so I added 
a quick unorded list of things the quiz covered so it would look a little more professional and less bare.
By the end of day 5 the general CSS and all of the front page were complete and it was ready to move on to the Javascript. 
I made a new text file and got right away to the button, that when clicked, would bring you to a new window where the quiz would actually start. Entering the this 
part was easy.

The hardest parts for me I would say would of been developing the progress bar. At first it wasnt working what so ever and it took me forever to really figure out
that the reason for the bar not working was because my script that was linked ot my html file wasnt linked properly the whole time. Then after that there was more
problems with the progress bar like at question 1 it would be at 0% and the by question 2 it was at 20% which just isnt right. Then I needed the bar to start at 0%
and at question 2 I needed it to say 10% and not 20 because you had not answered 20% of the questions yet. The next problem I faced was the functions to answer the
user with a right or wrong pop-up and then keep that judged answer after they've answered and keep it and score it out of 10. This part took me the longest no doubt.
